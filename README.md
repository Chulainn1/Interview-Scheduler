# Interview Scheduler

## Description 

Created a modern client app using the `React` view library in nine days. Development focused on creating a single page application allowing users to book, edit and delete an interview on any given day of the week. Data is persisted by an API server using a `PostgreSQL` database. Performed `Jest` testing throughout the development of this project, and performed end-to-end tests with `Cypress`.
